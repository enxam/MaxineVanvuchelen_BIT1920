Ensembl REST API queries: questions 12-13
-------------------------------------------

Question 12:
Give the mapping location of the variant rs499899635 in the zebrafish.

--> I first went to the rest.ensembl.org website to check which endpoint was
needed to find this information.
I found that the endpoint giving the mapping information is the variation one.
Then I set up the following curl command:
(I chose for the text/xml option because I find it more readable)


$ curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/variation/danio_rerio/rs499899635?' -H 'Content-type:text/xml'

Which resulted in the following information:

<opt>
  <data name="rs499899635" MAF="" ambiguity="Y" ancestral_allele="" minor_allele="" most_severe_consequence="intergenic_variant" source="Variants (including SNPs and indels) imported from dbSNP (mapped to GRCz11)" var_class="SNP">
    <mappings allele_string="T/C" assembly_name="GRCz11" coord_system="chromosome" end="10138412" location="10:10138412-10138412" seq_region_name="10" start="10138412" strand="1" />
  </data>
</opt>

---------------------------------------

Question 13:
Give the first 100 bases of the genomic FASTA sequence of
the Notch1 gene in the mouse.

--> I went back to the rest.ensembl.org website to check the needed endpoint.
This time I first chose for the xrefs endpoint in order to get the needed
Ensembl ID for the Notch1 gene in the mouse.
For this I used following curl command:

$ curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/xrefs/symbol/mus_musculus/Notch1?' -H 'Content-type:text/xml'

Which restuled in this information:

<opt>
  <data id="ENSMUSG00000026923" type="gene" />
</opt>

With this new information, I chose another endpoint to find the 
genomic FASTA sequence. For this I chose the sequence endpoint.
Following curl command was executed in terminal:

curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/id/ENSMUSG00000026923?type=genomic' -H 'Content-type:text/x-fasta'

The first line that is returned by this command is the following:

>ENSMUSG00000026923.15 chromosome:GRCm38:2:26457903:26516564:-1

So now the exact position of the Notch1 gene from mouse species is know 
and also on which chromosome it lies.

Now another endpoint from the REST API can be used to find the first 100 bases.
The sequence endpoint is used again for finding regions.

$ curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/region/mus_musculus/2:26457903..26458002:1?' -H 'Content-type:text/x-fasta'

And finally the first 100 bases of the Notch1 gene from the mouse are returned:

>chromosome:GRCm38:2:26457903:26458002:1
