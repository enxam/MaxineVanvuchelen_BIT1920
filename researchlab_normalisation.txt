Question 2: research lab normalisation
----------------------------------------

UNF
---

ResearchLab(PersonnelNumber, Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode, LabName, ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

--> the unnormalized form contains all the data in one entity

1NF
---

ResearchLab(PersonnelNumber(PK), Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode(PK), LabName, ResearchCode(PK), ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

--> the 1NF form contains primary keys (noted here with (PK)). These are 
PersonnelNumber, LabCode and ResearchCode.


2NF
---

ResearchLab(PersonnelNumber(PK), Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode(FK), ResearchCode(FK))
  Lab(LabCode(PK), LabName)
  Research(ResearchCode(PK), ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

--> two tables are added in the 2NF form, making every attribute of the table dependant
on the primary key of that table.
The labname has nothing to do with the personnel number, so this will be
placed in a separate table together with lab code, on which lab name does
depend. The same goes for Research description and research supervisor,
these are also not dependant on personnel number, but on research code.

3NF
---

ResearchLab(PersonnelNumber(PK), Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode(FK), ResearchCode(FK))
  Lab(LabCode(PK), LabName)
  Research(ResearchCode(PK), ResearchDescription, ResearchSupervisor)

For the 3NF form, everything stays the same because every non-prime attribute is
already non-transitively dependent on every key.
